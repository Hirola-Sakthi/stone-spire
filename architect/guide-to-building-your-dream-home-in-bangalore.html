Do you want open-plan living areas or more defined rooms?</li></ul><p>Creating a vision board can be helpful in visualizing your ideas. Stonespire Architects can assist you in refining your vision and translating it into practical design concepts.</p><h4><a id="_gixxtxxkzrt5"></a><strong>2. Set a Budget</strong></h4><p>Once you have a clear vision, the next step is to set a budget.
